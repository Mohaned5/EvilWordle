# evil_wordle

You probably know the game of Wordle‚Äù where you are supposed to guess a five-letter word. The feedback for guesses can help with the next guess (green letters are correct, orange letters are present, but in the wrong place). The idea of the program implemented here is to make the Wordle game as evil as possible by finding words that are the most difficult to guess.

## Concept

Based on the users first guess, the program finds the word which the user has the least possible chance of guessing.
